Had dirty bum but not sure if wet at the time. Sitting ~5m up a multi-stemmed mature Eucalyptus tereticornis (blue gum) by side of Atkinson Dam Road. Gum had dozens of little red flying foxes in it, and was part of a larger roost of many thousands. Was easy to approach as I approach from 'bad' eye side, and bat noise obscured the sound of my steps. I reported him to RSPCA in case missing eye was a current injury, and because dirty bum implies he had clamidia. They didn't come on the day, and he was gone by the time they were able to come.","","667e5431-c5f0-4e60-9a12-f2661ba1118b","","","","","","","Australia","AU","Queensland","","","","Atkinsons Dam QLD 4311, Australia","","","","","","","","","","","-27.420866","152.455094","EPSG:4326","15.0","","","-27.4208661148","","152.4550944194","","EPSG:4326","","","","","","","","",""
